Location data could allow health officials to monitor the disease—and our response to it:
Going mobile with contact tracing

For years, health workers have been tracking—and eventually containing—the spread of diseases through a method called contact tracing. Essentially, when patients test positive for a disease, health professionals will interview them to find out who they have been in close contact with and where they could have spread the disease.

While hospitals have been conducting this process manually for COVID-19 patients, Shekhar said using mobile location data would speed up the process significantly.

“COVID-19 is so fast-breaking and so large, you can see that it is overwhelming the manual contact tracing system,” he explained.

“That’s why today we need to help the contact tracing professionals with new tools, and one of those tools is smartphone trajectories,” he said.

Shekhar proposes a system in which medical records and spatial data work together. After compiling a dataset of patients who have tested positive for COVID-19, researchers could cross-check that data with smartphones that were close to that person during the infected period. Then, public health organizations could contact those who may have been infected and provide medical advice or recommend that they quarantine themselves for 14 days.

      <p>AI in repurposing drugs
 
One promising AI application is repurposing existing drugs that could be effective in treating COVID-19, in particular probing molecular structures. Russ Altman, MD, PhD, co-director of the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI, says that AI methods can be used to probe the three-dimensional pocket of critical proteins in the viral infection pathway.
“Increasingly in the last ten years, because we have so much data…many of the 3D-structure predictions and the drug-interaction prediction algorithms wind up being based on machine-learning technologies,” Altman says. “We use some AI methods to predict the 3D structure of a human protein that is used by [SARS-CoV-2] to infect and then we use another set of machine learning methods to try to find existing drugs that would fit into that pocket that we modeled in order to generate hypotheses.”
In another tack, Altman notes that using AI to examine EMRs can also help in repurposing drugs for COVID-19. The question there is: “Do I see patterns in the medications the patients are on, the pre-existing diseases they have or other elements of their EMRs that predict when they do poorly and when they do well?”
Altman explains that if a molecular prediction points to a small-molecule drug, and medical record databases show that patients taking that drug for another condition are not showing up in the ICU as would be expected, that’s interesting. “If we see that those same drugs are underrepresented in COVID-19 severe patients, that might suggest there’s been [an experiment] already done on these drugs indicating that they might be useful. These would give you a lot of confidence you’re on the right track.” (Altman held an information session on Quora in late April to answer questions about AI and COVID-19). https://www.genengnews.com/gen-edge/covid-19-puts-spotlight-on-artificial-intelligence/

      <p>TKaggle summary-  This website allows users to be able to access scholarly articles related to covid-19 to gain a better understanding. This dataset allows the community to create new ideas and to support the fight against covid-19. AI and other techniques are being shared with the community on how to assist with the virus. In this research challenge, they are issuing a call to action to AI experts to develop data mining tools to help the medical company, if these tools are used they could help better understand the biology and chemistry of the virus so that scientists will have a better understanding of how covid-19 works. In this dataset, there are tasks questions to help assist viewers with a better understanding and view point. Throughout this dataset, there is constant encouragement about research and development on data mining. Data mining would help tremendously to help gain more information to help generate new ideas.

In this dataset challenge the tasks can consist of questions relating to genetics, origin, and evolution. This could give answers to what are genetics, how are they evolving etc. There are many graphs and examples demonstrated by multiple users to help better understand the issues involving the covid-19. Throughout this dataset challenge, AI seems to be a very crucial part of development against covid-19 simulations, this seems to be the main factor and objective. Many researchers can submit a discussion or tasks that others will be able to see and piggyback off of. This is ideal having many developers come together and share their knowledge on key information, this will only help this predicament that is going on.

      <p>The pandemic drone- In Australia, Javaan Chahl, a professor of sensor systems at the University of South Australia, is working in collaboration with Canada-based drone tech firm Draganfly to create a drone-based system that could help local authorities around the world identify or predict COVID-19 hotspots.
Chahl started to work on the software—a one-of-a-kind computer vision technology system—that now powers the drone system back in 2014. Initially, his team explored using the technology for measuring vital signs in premature babies. "The idea was to replace some of the invasive instrumentation that currently exists for neonatal babies," Chahl says, referring to adhesive electrodes. They also demonstrated this tech's potential use in disaster relief missions. An October 2019 study in the journal Remote Sensing found that his computer vision system could successfully detect—from 4 to 8 meters above the ground—signs of breathing in humans. The system can also discover living people buried under debris.
The computer vision system can measure heart rate of people based on changes in their skin tone. Heart beating causes variation in blood flow in the face and other places in the body. "It's very subtle signal but [the system] can see it," says Chahl. Beyond that, the system detects breathing/respiratory signals by detecting cyclic movements of the chest. These features use traditional signal processing technology.
As SARS-CoV-2 started ravaging China and other countries, Draganfly inked a contract with the University of South Australia to integrate Chahl's software into its drones. "Until now it was much more about image processing than the drone itself," says Chahl. "That changed when the virus started to appear."

      <p>Mewburn.com- A British company that specialises in AI-powered drug design (spun off by some of the authors of this paper) has recently announced that they would be applying their expertise to screen a large library of drugs to identify compounds that could interfere with the replication or entry into human cells of Sars-CoV-2 (the virus behind the COVID-19 epidemic). If they are successful, this could arm us with new means to fight the virus in as little as 12 months (depending on many factors including how clinical trials would be necessary and how we are able to manufacture the new drug).

Computational biology can also help with the design of a vaccine for Sars-CoV-2. As explained in this review, mathematical modelling of viral evolution can help us understand how a virus evolves to escape the immune system. We can then use this information to be “one step ahead” of the virus in designing a vaccine. Researchers across the world are gathering genetic information about Sars-CoV-2 as it spreads, building the data set that is needed for us to better understand how this virus changes. This will be a crucial piece of information for any vaccine that is being developed now to protect us against the virus that we will be facing by the time a vaccine is ready for mass production.
